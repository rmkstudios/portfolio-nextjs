            <h2>Development Specs</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This React app uses Firebase for its backend. Despite being a
                private app (signups are off), it operates with multiple user
                accounts storing their own individual workout data.
              </li>
              <li>
                A lot of Chakra UI elements were used in this page for the form
                fields as well as multiple dropdown menus (sort/delete).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Design Choices</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                For a good UX, simplicity is key. I wanted the entire site to
                function on a single page. And the green/orange colors were used
                sparingly to draw the user&apos;s attention to the most
                important action elements of the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Mobile Responsiveness was extra important on this project
                because most users would be inputting their data on their phone
                at the gym.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                This was my first time working with firebase - which at first
                was a bit confusing. But after digging into the documentation
                and several YouTube videos, it all started working swimmingly!
              </li>
              <li>
                Despite not having open registration, there still is
                multiple-user access. Learning how to filter through firebase
                data and work with a single user&apos;s data was important to
                figure out for this project.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The obvious next step is to give users the ability to add their
                own workouts to the list. This would just require me changing
                from hard-coded workouts to an array generated by sorting
                through their current workouts on firebase.
              </li>
              <li>
                I didn&apos;t include a new account signup feature in the
                current build due to it not being a public app. If I were to
                open it up to the public, that would be the next important
                implementation (and fairly straightforward through firebase).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <BackToPortfolio />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </>
